    desc:<t>Story</t>There really isn't that much in terms of story (or at least not yet anyawy). Just enable Hailey to live her best life by making her do activities and getting upgrades!<//><t>FP</t>Friendship points are the secondary resource in Hailey Idle. Since I don't know where else I can put this info, it'll reside here for now. So, here's what you need to know:<.>FP is essential for progression.<.>Increasing FPpS will include sacrificing HPpS.<.>FP will be spent on something I am yet to implement (mainly due to the fact that I don't know how to implement it).
